# Altium PCB Panel Generator Script

This repository contains a DelphiScript for Altium Designer that automates the generation of a panel based on an existing PCB design. This script simplifies the process of creating panels for PCB fabrication, making it more efficient and error-free.

## Introduction

When designing PCBs in Altium Designer, creating panels for fabrication is a common and crucial step. Manually creating these panels can be time-consuming and error-prone. This DelphiScript automates the panel creation process, saving you time and reducing the risk of mistakes.

## Features

* **Automated Panel Generation:** The script takes an existing PCB design and generates a panel layout based on user-defined parameters.
* **User-Friendly:** The script provides a user-friendly interface within Altium Designer, making it accessible to both novice and experienced users.
* **Customizable:** You can customize the script to suit your specific panelization requirements.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Altium Designer.
3. Create a new PCB document where you want the panel to be generated. **IMPORTANT**: Make sure to run this script while this new PCB document is open and active.
4. In Altium Designer, go to `File` -> `Run Script...`.
5. Browse and select the **Panelizer.PrjScr** file from the downloaded repository.
6. Select the desired PCB to panelize with the Search button.
7. Select the number of boards in X and Y.
8. Select the column and row spacing desired.
9. Set the position of the embedded PCB boards.
10. Click OK et voil√†.

## TODO

1. Make it possible to run the script from anywhere within altium and that it automatically creates the target document.
2. Allow the user to change the layer where the panel is drawn.
3. (Maybe) Make a special customization mode, where all panel variables are accessible to modify (drill distance, fiducials, etc.)
